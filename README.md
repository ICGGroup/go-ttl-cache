# Time-to-live Cache 

The Time-to-live Cache Service provides fast caching that features persistence to a BoltDB data store.  This allows the cache to persist for longer durations or with large datasets without requiring significant memory on the server.  The intention is to provide a caching mechanism that can be used in a variety of circumstances and reduces the impact of frequent, intensive queries on the database server or other backend server.
